# vue2048
The Game 2048 developed by vue.
The origin project is [vue-2048](https://github.com/pengfu/vue-2048).  
I used Vue-cli 3.0 to rebuild this project and simplify the config file.On other hand,I also used [vue-touch](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-touch) to achieve swipe action in mobile terminal.Last but not least,the ui of starting and ending in game were optimized a bit.:D 

~~To be honest,there's still a bug that cells become invisible when the board is full.In a formal way,you can pass the game.Just settle for it, I'm trying to fix it.XD~~

Eventually, I fixed it!(ﾉ´▽｀)ﾉ♪
