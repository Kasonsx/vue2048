# vue2048
The Game 2048 developed by vue.
The origin project is [vue-2048](https://github.com/pengfu/vue-2048).  
I used Vue-cli 3.0 to rewrite this project and used vue-touch to add swipe action.

To be honest,there's still a bug that cells become invisible when the board is full.In a formal way,you can pass the game.XD
